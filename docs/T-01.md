# 1. Current purchase price

Get the present buying price.

- Only these products should be included, which supplier product has `isPrimarySupplierProduct` `true`

Data output:

- `SupplierProducts.productUID`
- `Products.productSKU`
- `PurchasePricesOfSupplierProducts.spPurchasePrice`

## Issues

- `Products` table contains several products with the same `productSKU`. The problem remains unsolved. As a result, retrieving up-to-date purchase costs according to unique product SKU is not possible now.
- Queries of this kind are sluggish. The speed isn't critical if all you're doing is exporting data. For several live activities that rely on the current purchase price, it is recommended to utilise materialised view to cache data and refresh it as the underlying data is updated. In this particular scenario, materialised view is over fifty times quicker than live view.  You can use this materialised view also to get the current price of a one specific product.

Duplicate SKU's

- `1986762819747`
- `0985476709647`

## Code

```sql
with "CurrentPurchasePrice" as (
--
    select --
           sprd."productUID",
           (array_agg(spp."spPurchasePrice"
                      order by spp."datePurchasePriceEffective" desc))[1] as "spPurchasePrice"
    from fd."PurchasePricesOfSupplierProducts" spp
             join fd."SupplierProducts" sprd
                  on sprd."supplierProductUID" = spp."supplierProductUID"
                      and sprd."isPrimarySupplierProduct"
    where spp."datePurchasePriceEffective" <= now()::date
    group by sprd."productUID"
    --
)
select cpp."productUID", prd."productSKU", cpp."spPurchasePrice"
from "CurrentPurchasePrice" cpp
         join fd."Products" prd on prd."productUID" = cpp."productUID";
```
